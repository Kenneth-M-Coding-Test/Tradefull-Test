## Kenneth McInturf Coding Test

Thanks for giving the opportunity to continue in the interview process, and I am excited to show you my project.

### Running the App
- Clone this repo down, and run `composer install`
- Be sure to set your `.env` with your local database setup (can use .env.example as template)
- Run `php artisan migrate` within project directory to bring up the database
- I just put a local server up for deployment. Running `php artisan serve` within the projects directory on your machince will allow you to run the app locally from `<http://127.0.0.1:8000>`

### Items
- App is based on a database with one table, Item
- Item.php defines what the class is, and ItemController handles any interactions between DB and the front end
- Made with jQuery and Bootstrap
- Will have the ability to create, edit, view, and delete an item record, in a way that is mostly not terrible

## Conclusion
Thanks again for taking the time to review this project, and to speak with me about Tradefull. I look forward to any feedback from this project, and hope to speak with y'all again soon!
